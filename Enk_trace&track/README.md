# Enk
The Enk system was built in occasion of the 2020 Maxonrow [MAXathon](https://hackathon.maxonrow.com/) by the Enk team.

## Requirements
An Intel Edison Arduino board with a cross-compiled mraa ([TUTORIAL](https://github.com/eclipse/mraa/issues/303#issuecomment-145231175))is needed for this system to work.
## The challenge

> ### **Virtualizing the New Norm**
> Physical distancing has been adopted by almost every country to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and ensure everyone's safety during a pandemic.
> 
> However, for the vast majority of us, our regular activities require
> us to be physically present around one another. People are now forced
> to reexamine ways to conduct their daily activities, which also sparks
> the conversation on how blockchain technology, especially non-fungible
> tokens (NFTs), can help us navigate and adapt to this change?

## Our proposed solution
We've built a trace and track application powered by blockchain technology that can verify the authenticity of a drug package. Sensors in the smart locker can alert about the current state of the drug and its integrity. Smart contracts can streamline repetitive and time-consuming tasks for a faster drug delivery.

## Installation
